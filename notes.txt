"url": "http://instantatlas.com/apps/ia-designer/dist/"

for quicker testing

Theres no way of stopping autoupdater from installing a new version once autoUpdater.checkForUpdates() is called. 
It will be installed silently when the app is closed, even if you clicked to install later.

Added http-server for testing.
http-server C:\Work\InstantAtlasReports\ia-designer 
http://10.20.0.103:8080/

Added mime types to web.config for http://oxygen/ia-designer/ (see web.config)
<mimeMap fileExtension=".7z" mimeType="application/x-7z-compressed" />
<mimeMap fileExtension=".yml" mimeType="application/yaml" />

replaced electron-prebuilt with electron because electron-updater was breaking with old version of electron-prebuilt.
electron-prebuilt and electron are the same package - its now advised to use electron.

Installed asar for opening asar files. asar --help
